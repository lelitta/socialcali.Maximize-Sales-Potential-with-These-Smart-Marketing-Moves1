                </p>
                <p>

                    Before making any improvements, we conduct a comprehensive audit of your website to identify areas that need optimization. This process includes analyzing site speed, mobile compatibility, keyword rankings, and overall user experience. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We develop a strategic plan to enhance your website’s performance and search visibility by identifying weaknesses and opportunities.

                    We address backend technical issues, such as site speed optimization, schema markup implementation, XML sitemaps, and mobile-friendliness improvements to ensure search engines can crawl and index your site efficiently.
                </p>
                <p><b>6. Off-Page SEO and Link Building</b></p>
